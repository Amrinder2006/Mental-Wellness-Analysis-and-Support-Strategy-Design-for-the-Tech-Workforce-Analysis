# Mental Wellness Analysis and Support Strategy Design for the Tech Workforce

## üìù Project Summary

This capstone project delves into the mental health landscape of the tech industry. The primary goal is to analyze factors influencing the mental well-being of tech professionals and to predict their likelihood of seeking treatment. The project employs a multi-faceted approach, combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and customer segmentation to derive actionable insights.

The key components of this analysis include:
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed to uncover initial patterns, correlations, and insights within the dataset.
* **Data Preprocessing:** A robust pipeline was constructed using `ColumnTransformer` to handle feature engineering, scaling (`StandardScaler`, `RobustScaler`), and encoding (`OneHotEncoder`) to prepare the data for modeling.
* **Classification:** Supervised learning models, specifically **Random Forest** and **XGBoost classifiers**, were trained to predict whether an individual in the tech workforce would seek mental health treatment.
* **Regression:** **Random Forest** and **XGBoost regressors** were used to predict the age of the respondents based on their survey answers.
* **Clustering:** Unsupervised learning was used to segment the workforce into distinct groups. Dimensionality reduction techniques like **PCA, t-SNE, KernelPCA, and UMAP** were evaluated, with UMAP providing the best separation. Subsequently, **K-Means** and **Agglomerative Clustering** were applied to identify and profile different employee archetypes based on their mental health attitudes and workplace environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amrinder2006/Mental-Wellness-Analysis-and-Support-Strategy-Design-for-the-Tech-Workforce-Analysis.git
    cd Mental-Wellness-Analysis-and-Support-Strategy-Design-for-the-Tech-Workforce-Analysis
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    * **For Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **For macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    A `requirements.txt` file should be in the root directory. Install the necessary libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can create one with the following contents:*
    ```
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn
    xgboost
    umap-learn
    streamlit
    joblib
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit Application**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can launch the interactive web application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
