## 📝 Project Description  
This project aims to understand key factors influencing mental health among tech employees and build data-driven solutions for improving workplace well-being. It uses machine learning techniques to perform classification, regression, and clustering tasks and presents results via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

### **Objectives**
To understand the key factors influencing mental health issues among employees in the tech industry and
build data-driven solutions for:
- **Classification Task:** Predict whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment.
- **Regression Task:** Predict the age of an individual based on personal and workplace attributes, supporting age-targeted intervention design.
- **Unsupervised Task:** Segment tech employees into distinct clusters based on mental health indicators to aid in tailored HR policies
